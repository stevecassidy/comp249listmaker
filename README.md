# Listmaker

This is a simple Bottle application for making lists of things.  It 
has been written to support a lab exercise for COMP249 at Macquarie 
University.  

Your task is to add handlers to provide a JSON view of the 
data and allow updates via POST requests of JSON data. 

See the comments in listmaker.py for instructions.
